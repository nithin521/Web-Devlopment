display
1)Block elements: headings, paragraphs and div, body(which doesn't allow other elements to sit in the same line. which captures whole width of the page)
2)Inline elements: images anchours are different from block where we can write elements side by side one after other in the same line)
for to use display and block elements combined we need to use display: inline-block; to change width as well as to set elements in same line ;
3)none: it will hide the character from the line and removes the block
4)visibility: hide; whereas hide allows to hide the character but the character's block remains there when other element enter it is going to be right after this hidden character instead of occupying the hidden character)
